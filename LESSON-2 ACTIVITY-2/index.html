        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant">Plants are the eukaryotes that form the kingdom Plantae; they are predominantly photosynthetic. This means that they
        obtain their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria to produce sugars
        from carbon dioxide and water, using the green pigment chlorophyll. Exceptions are parasitic plants that have lost the
        genes for chlorophyll and photosynthesis, and obtain their energy from other plants or fungi. Most plants are
        multicellular, except for some green algae.</blockquote>
